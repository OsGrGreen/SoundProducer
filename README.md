A tiny tool to make "music" or sounds!

Every key on the keyboard corresponds to a sound "wave". All these waves can be individually set (amplitude, and so on). Multiple waves can also be combined (added together), by pressing multiple keys at once.

Maybe use rust (with sdl2) for backend, and opengl + rust for frontend ig.


Will (right now) need user to have SDL2 installed.
